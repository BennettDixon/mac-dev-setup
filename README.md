# Welcome
I'm setting up a new Mac for development and need to share some config so I am making a repository to store it.

This repo is a work in progress, but feel free to reference it.

Eventually I'd like to make this an Ansible template.


## Tools
- brew
- zsh (install with brew)
- nvm
- npm & pnpm
- python
- poetry
