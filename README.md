# Welcome
I'm setting up a new Mac for development and need to share some config so I am making a repository to store it, as well as document the list of tools I typically setup on a fresh development environment.

This repo is a work in progress, but feel free to reference it.

Eventually I'd like to make this an Ansible template.


## Tools
- brew
- zsh (install with brew)
- oh-my-zsh
- power10k theme for oh-my-zsh: https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k 
- iTerm (iTerm2 specifically)
- nvm
- Docker desktop
- npm & pnpm
- pyenv for python version management
- python versions installed with pyenv
- poetry
